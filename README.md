# values and variable

# naming convention

- camelCase
- can start with $
- can start with \_ underscore
- can have underscore in between
- cannot start with numeric literal
- naming convention for CONST eg: PI
- cannot have reserved work eg: new , function
- $new, $function are accepted
- name is OK but not suggested
- eg of - descriptive variable - myFirstJob, myCurrentJob
- eg of - nondescriptive variable - job1, job2

# Assignment

- Declare variables called college, course, and students and assign their values according to your own college and display them

# Code Commenting

- single line
- multiline
- vsCode shortcuts - ctrl + /

# Data Type

## 7 Primitive Data Types - are value type (Except Object - not value type)

- number - are always floating point even though we don't see them (decimal and integer)
- string - sequence of character - single or double quotes
- boolean - logical type - true or false - used for taking decision
- undefined - variable with empty value or not defined - let myValue
- null - means empty value
- symbol - ES2015 - Not used, value that is unique and cannot be changed
- bigint - ES2020 - Larger intergers than the Number type can hold

# Dynamic Type

- We don't need to manually define the type -
- In js value has the type not variable
- Variable x can be a number and string later

# Dynamic typing (Typeof)

- Null - "object"
- Undefined - "undefined"
- Boolean
- Number
- BigInt
- String
- Symbol

# Assignments

- Declare a variable isIsland and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable language, but don't assign it any value yet
- Log the types of isIsland, population, country and language

# let, const and var

- let - we can change value
- const - cannot
- var - similar to let

# Assignments

- store your personal details - collegeName, batch, studentName, uniRegNo, isITFaculty

# Basic Operators

- substract "-"
- add "+"
- multiply "\*"
- divide "/"
- 2 \*\* 3, 2 power 3

# String Concatenate

# String and Template literals

# Assignments

- Output should be - "My name is sakar aryal. I'm currently studying BCA in kalika. It is located in Butwal"

# Math Operators

- const now = 2024; const ageSakar = now - 1998;
- 2 \*\* 3 ( 2 power 3)

# Assignment Operators

- x = 10
- x + = 10
- x \*= 4
- x ++; x--; x--

# Comparison Operators

- > , <, >=, <=
- const isFullAge = ageSamir >=18

# Operator Precedence

# Assignment

- Find the BMI
- Store your height in meter - johnHeight
- Store your mass - johnMass
- Formula BMI = mass/(height \* height)
- If in range (18.5 to 24.9) - Display "john is healthy"
- If not in range - Display "john is not healthy"

# Assignment

- create BMI of two person
- compare and show which one has highest and lowest
- output - john BMI is higher than john BMI
- output - john BMI is higher than john \*\*\* BMI

# If Else statement - Let's make decision

- Program to take driver's license of not
- Expected output - "Daniel can start driving license" or "Daniel cannot start driving license"

# Assignment

- Show how many years left to get driver's license
- Output - "Daniel can start driving license" or "Daniel cannot start driving license, wait another 2 years"

# Assignment

- Write a program to find if the person is born in 20th century or 21st century
- birthYear <=2000 is 21st century
- Expected outcome - "Sakar is born in 20th century or Sakar is born in 21st century

# Conversion of string to Number

- From string to Number and viceverca
- inputYear = '1998'
- In inputYear + 18 year, you'll become 18 years of age ( This doesn't work)
- console.log(Number(inputYear), inputYear) - see difference

# Conversion of Number to String

# Type coercion

- Converting of value from one data type to another
- console.log(`I'm ` + 23 + ' years old')
- console.log(`I'm ` + '23' + ' years old')
- console.log('23' - '10' - 3)
- console.log('23' + '10' + 3 + "4")
- console.log('23' \* '2')
- console.log('23' / '2')

# Guess the output

- let n = '1' + 1
- n = n - 1
- console.log(n)
- 2 + 3 + 4 + '5'
- '10' - '4' - '3' - '2' + '5

# Truthy and Falsy Values

- Falsy value are not exactly false, but it will became false when we try to compare
- 5 falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN
- console.log(Boolean(0)) // false
- Boolean(undefined) // false
- Boolean('') //false
- Boolean('sakar') // true
- Boolean({}) //true

# Type coercion in if else

- show if else for above program

# Equality Operator

- ===
- ==

# Basic Boolean logic

- AND, OR & NOT

# Assignment

- Write a program to display if you can have drivingLicense or not -
- Requirement age must be 18 or more
- You must have good vision

# Assignment

- Team Dhoni scores 90, 108, 168
- Team Kholi scores 90, 80, 101
- Find average of each and display the highest - one with highest will win trophy
- Must cover for draw

# Ternary comparison operator

# Logical Operator
